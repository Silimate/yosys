Clock gating



need to determine when the D == Q

Make sure that the flip flop has a clock but not ce: !ff.has_ce && ff.has_clk
check if 

USE sat to determine when the Q is the same as D

Q is the feedback, and then there's also the D which does in and select for the mux
becomes the enable


D = f(Q, other_inputs)

!(D ^ f(Q, other_inputs))


Look somewhat like this:
	Q is always going to be D
	But D itself has an enable built into it


	So what D really is is:
		Mux (D_r, Q, en) where en is the enable signal

		Our goal is to find en

		Equation:
		Q_next = (en ∧ D_r) ∨ (¬en ∧ Q)

		Equality question:
		!((Q_next) ^ ((en ∧ D_r) ∨ (¬en ∧ Q)))

		Universal Quantization
		FA(Q_next, D_r, Q) !((Q_next) ^ ((en ∧ D_r) ∨ (¬en ∧ Q)))

		SAT Equation
		FA(Q_next, D_r, Q) !((Q_next) ^ ((en ∧ D_r) ∨ (¬en ∧ Q)))
